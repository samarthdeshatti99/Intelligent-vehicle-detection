# Vehicle Detection and Counting

A real-time deep learning–based vehicle detection and counting built using modern object detection algorithms. The system detects and counts vehicles in video streams using **YOLOv8n**, providing fast and accurate performance suitable for intelligent transportation and smart city applications.

## 🚗 Project Overview

This project applies state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to detect and count:

* Cars
* Buses
* Trucks

The system processes video frames in real time and uses a **line-crossing technique** to count vehicles as they pass a predefined virtual line.

Tracking is handled through lightweight NumPy-based logic, ensuring efficient performance without heavy external tracking frameworks.


## 🎯 Why This Work Is Important

Vehicle detection and counting systems are widely used in:

* Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
* Smart city traffic monitoring
* Road congestion analysis
* Highway safety management
* Automated toll collection systems
* Urban planning and infrastructure research

Deep learning–based approaches such as YOLO provide:

* Higher detection accuracy
* Better robustness in complex environments
* Real-time performance
* Strong generalization capability

Compared to classical computer vision methods, modern deep learning models significantly improve detection reliability under varying lighting, weather, and traffic conditions.
